## Form Basic Validation
###### The code is intended to apply the following basic validations on the HTML-Form.

The form is validated against:
- Required field validation.
- Data-format validation using `regex`.
- Data minimum and maximum-length validation using `regex`.

Please go through the code and suggest, if any optimization or refinery is needed.
Thank you
